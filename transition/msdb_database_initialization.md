# MSDB Database Initialization

Django can do most of the database setup work.  However, you need a few
prerequisites, and then you need to perform the following bootstrap process.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 2.7** installed
2. **PostgreSQL** installed
3. `brata.masterserver` installed in /opt/designcallenge2016)
4. Your computer has a user account with username "pi"
5. cd to /opt/designchallenge2016/brata.master/ms
## Names you can configure

This document uses the following identifiers and values in its examples.
You may want to substitute different values for your configuration.

Identifier | Meaning
-----------|--------
pi         | system account user name and database user name
raspberry  | system password for user "pi" and database password for user "pi"
msdb       | Master Server database name

## Procedure

### 1. Create a database user named "pi" and a database named "msdb"

Use the `psql` command line utility that comes with PostgreSQL.  You can
also accomplish the same thing through the `pgadmin` GUI, but it is harder
to explain here. DO NOT use raspberry as shown below use the password agreed
to by the team.

```
# psql -U postgres
psql (9.4.4)
WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)
         8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference
         page "Notes for Windows users" for details.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE USER pi WITH PASSWORD 'raspberry';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE msdb;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE msdb TO pi;
GRANT
postgres=# \q
```

Now you should have an empty database.

### 2. Initialize the database structure

This is done by Django's `manage.py` utility.  It will create tables based
on the Django models in our code.

If you were starting from scratch, you would do `makemigrations` to scan the
models and generate the operations needed to modify the database to reflect
those models.  However, if you cloned the `ms` code repository, those migrations
have already been generated.  You just need to apply them.

So you **do not need** to do this:

```
# python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'piservice':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model PiEvent
    - Create model PiStation
    - Add field piID to pievent
    - Add field teamID to pievent
Migrations for 'dbkeeper':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model Admin
    - Create model Mentor
    - Create model School
    - Create model Team
    - Add field school to mentor
    - Add field teams to mentor
```

You can apply the migrations that already exist in the Django project to the
database using the `migrate` command to `manage.py`, like this:

```
# python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Synchronize unmigrated apps: staticfiles, messages
  Apply all migrations: sessions, admin, auth, contenttypes, piservice, dbkeeper
Synchronizing apps without migrations:
  Creating tables...
    Running deferred SQL...
  Installing custom SQL...
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying dbkeeper.0001_initial... OK
  Applying piservice.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

Now you should have a database with tables named School, Mentor, Team,
PiStation, PiEvent, and a few other Django administrative tables.

### 3. Load content into the database

We can pre-populate the database with some initial content for testing
during development.  We could also use the same technique to load up any
real-content on game day that we were able to prepare in advance.  This
example uses a file called `initial_content.sql`, but there will probably
be multiple of these files:  some for testing, and some for actual deployment.

```
# sudo -U psql postgres -d msdb < db_backup.sql
```

`initial_content.sql` would be a file created using the `pg_dump` command
to dump the contents of a previous version of the `msdb` database.

### 4. Create a Django *superuser*

You will need this to log into the Django *admin* interface.

```
# python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'ellery'): pi
Email address:
Password: raspberry
Password (again): raspberry
Superuser created successfully.
```

### 5. See if it worked

To see if it worked, connect to the Django app's *admin* interface using your
web browser.  If you already have the Django app deployed in Apache, just
visit http://localhost/admin/.

If you don't have Apache running, run the Django development server, like this:

```
# python manage.py runserver
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
August 30, 2015 - 19:34:36
Django version 1.8.3, using settings 'ms.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```

Then connect to it with this URL:  http://localhost:8000/admin

You should see the Django login screen.

After logging in successfully, you should see the top level of the
*Django administration* panel.  From there you can add other
administrative and non-adminstrative users and assign them to groups with
specific permissions.


# Deleting the Database and Starting Over during Development

Sometimes during development you may cause the database to get corrupted, and you just
want to delete it and start from scratch or from some earlier saved state.

## Preparation

If you want to preserve any of the database contents, back up the database using the
procedure described [here](ms_deployment.md).  The backup may not be restorable if
the database schema changes between the backup and the restore.  If that is the case
you may be better off trying to use

```sh
# python manage.py makemigrations
# python manage.py migrate
```

Sometimes `migrate` will not work either, because there is existing content in the
database and Django cannot figure out how to convert it from the current database
representation to the new representation.  Sometimes it will just throw an
exception during the migration.  If that occurs, you may have to delete the
database and start over.

## 1.  Delete the existing database

```sh
# sudo -U postgres psql -c "DROP DATABASE msdb;"
```

## 2.  Create a new database

```sh
# sudo -U postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE msdb;"
# sudo -U postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE msdb TO pi;"
```

## 3.  Run the Django migrations on the new database

This will create the tables.

```sh
# python manage.py migrate
```
Sometimes this will not work either. See the waht to do if the migrations are broken section.

## 4.  Restore the database contents

```sh
# sudo -U postgres psql -d msdb < db_backup.sql
```

## 5.  (Re-)Create a superuser

You need to create a super user account to be able to log in to
the Django *admin* interface.

```sh
# python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'currentuser'): pi
Email address: pi@example.com
Password: raspberry
Password (again): raspberry
Superuser created successfully.
```

# What to do if your migrations are broken

Sometimes the accumulation of incremental migrations might get broken to a point where they
can no longer be successfully applied.  Then you need to delete them, delete the database, 
and let Django create a new set of migrations starting with the current state of your models.
This is very similar to the previous procedure of deleting the database and re-creating it.

## Delete the migrations

First, delete the old migrations.

```sh
# rm dbkeeper/migrations/*
# rm piservice/migrations/*
```

## Generate new migrations

You may find that when you try to do the `makemigrations`, this happens:

```sh
# python manage.py makemigrations
No changes detected
```

So do this instead:  create the initial migrations for each app individually.

```sh
# python manage.py makemigrations dbkeeper
Migrations for 'dbkeeper':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model MSUser
    - Create model Organization
    - Create model Team
    - Add field organization to msuser
    - Add field teams to msuser
    - Add field user to msuser

# python manage.py makemigrations piservice
Migrations for 'piservice':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model PiEvent
    - Create model PiStation
    - Add field pi to pievent
    - Add field team to pievent

If that doesn't work you may need to flush first, then makemigrations and then migrate
```sh
# python manage.py sqlflush
# python manage.py flush
```

# python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Synchronize unmigrated apps: staticfiles, messages
  Apply all migrations: sessions, admin, auth, contenttypes, piservice, dbkeeper
Synchronizing apps without migrations:
  Creating tables...
    Running deferred SQL...
  Installing custom SQL...
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying dbkeeper.0001_initial... OK
  Applying piservice.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

Then go back and create the super user using the instructions above.
